Importing SAS files

In this exercise, you'll figure out how to import a SAS file as a DataFrame using SAS7BDAT and pandas. The file 'sales.sas7bdat' is already in your working directory and both pandas and matplotlib.pyplot have already been imported as follows:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
The data are adapted from the website of the undergraduate text book Principles of Econometrics by Hill, Griffiths and Lim.


Import the module SAS7BDAT from the library sas7bdat.
In the context of the file 'sales.sas7bdat', load its contents to a DataFrame df_sas, using the method to_data_frame() on the object file.
Print the head of the DataFrame df_sas.
Execute your entire script to produce a histogram plot!
